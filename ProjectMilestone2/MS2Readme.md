# Project Management Tool

Our group decided to try out Trello for managing our project. 
We liked the interface and feel pretty good about the organization of everything.
Since we are currrently still learning how to get everything working and connected,
it is difficult to determine the number of sprints needed and all tasks required 
for the project.

Organization:
The "Current" list is for tasks that are currently being worked on. 
We will use tags to indicate what state they are in.
Blue: Finished and approved. 
Green: Finished, needs approval.
Yellow: In progress.

The "Backlog" list is for tasks that we can move forward with and can 
be moved to Current if someone takes on the task by adding themselves as a Member.

The "Icebox" list is for tasks that we will eventually need to address but 
have to wait on. These can either go to the Backlog or the Current list.

The "Feature Progress" list is to indicate how far we are along for implementing our desired features. Progress is based on tasks needed to be completed. We will use labels to indicate the progress
Red = No progress made
Orange = ~25% done
Yellow = ~50% done
Green = ~75% done
Blue = Feature fully implemented

The "Completed Tasks" list is for tasks we finished in past sprints. 

# Plan Cycle within the Project Management Method 

This is outlined in the ThreeWeekSprint.pdf file in the Milestone2 directory.

# Agile Methodology

Our group recorded a scrum meeting. Since this was our first official scrum meeting, 
we didn't have a lot to say on past work so it ended fairly early. This recording is 
the GroupScrum.m4a file found in the Milestone2 directory. 

As for our group retrospective, we felt that some of the tasks assigned were fairly 
easily accomplished while others weren't. This caused an uneven distribusion of work 
within the team for the sprint. To change this we decided to create a numbering system 
for task difficulty that way we can give one member a few smalled tasks while we give 
another one large task, this way everyone is continually working which will also get 
our project done faster. We did however feel as though there was good communication 
for evything being done through our Slack group.
